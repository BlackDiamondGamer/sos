	<h2><u>Advantages of Social media</u></h2>

	<div class="demon5">
<ul><b>

	<li>
	Brand awareness - Compelling and relevant content will grab the attention of potential customers and increase brand visibility. See branding: the basics.
	</li>
<br>
	<li>
	Brand reputation - You can respond instantly to industry developments and be seen as 'thought leader' or expert in your field. This can improve how your business is seen by your audience. See public relations (PR).
	</li>
<br>
	<li>
	Cost effective - It can be much cheaper than traditional advertising and promotional activities. The costs of maintaining a social media presence are minimal. If you choose to invest in paid advertising, you can spend as much or as little as your budget allows.
	</li></b>

</ul>

	<h2><u>Disadvantages of Social Media</u></h2>

<ul><b>
	<li>Resources - You will need to commit resources to managing your social media presence, responding to feedback and producing new content. This can include hiring and training staff, investing in paid advertising and paying for the costs of creating video or image content.</li>
<br>
	<li>Evaluation - While it is easy to quantify the return-on-investment in terms of online sales generated by social media advertising - there are some less tangible benefits. It can be hard to measure and place a monetary value on the brand awareness and reputation that social media can bring. It's difficult to know how social media effects sales in-store.</li>
<br>
	<li>Ineffective use - Social media can be used ineffectively. For example, using social media to push for sales without engaging with customers, or failing to respond to negative feedback - may damage your reputation.</li></b>
